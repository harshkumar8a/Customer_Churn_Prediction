📊 Customer Churn Prediction Model
🔍 Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry

🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers. This project builds an end-to-end machine learning using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression to predict churn effectively.
📌 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing: Categorical to numerical conversion via LabelEncoder.
✅ Handling Imbalanced Data: Using SMOTE oversampling to balance the dataset.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns and correlations.
✅ Model Training & Selection: Evaluating multiple classifiers to select the best-performing model (Random Forest).
✅ Model Deployment: Saving and loading the trained model for real-time prediction.

📊 Technologies & Tools Used
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- 🎯 Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost for model training
- 🏗 SMOTE for handling imbalanced datasets
- 🖼 Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
