**Customer Churn Prediction Model**

  ðŸš€ Predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques 

  **Project Overview**
    This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle (Telecom datasets). The workflow includes:
    - Data Preprocessing: Converting categorical data into numerical using LabelEncoder.
    - Handling Imbalanced Data: Utilizing SMOTE for oversampling.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends and feature distributions.
    - Model Training: Implementing multiple classifiers:- Random Forest (Best Model)
    - XGBoost
    - Logistic Regression
  
    - Model Evaluation: Selecting the most accurate model based on performance metrics.
    - Model Deployment: Saving and loading the trained model to build a predictive system.
    
  **  Technologies Used**  
    - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
    - SMOTE for oversampling
    - Label Encoding for categorical data transformation
    - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
